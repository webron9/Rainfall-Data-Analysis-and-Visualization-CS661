# Rainfall-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization[CS661-Course_Project]

### Project Description
- Utilized Python and Plotly Dash to visually represent historical rainfall and temperature data for India spanning 1901-2002.
Processed Indian Meteorological Department’s Gridded Monthly Rainfall and Temperature Time Series dataset, applying
data cleaning techniques to address missing values and errors in the dataset.
- Created interactive visualizations using Plotly Dash, including a heatmap of rainfall across states and zoomed-in state-specific
views. Implemented filtering options for selecting specific year spans and months, enabling user-driven exploration.
- Showcased expertise in data preprocessing, interactive visualization, and analysis, revealing trends in India’s weather
patterns. Employed Choropleth graph functions to generate maps, seamlessly integrating JSON data on districts and states.
- Successfully uncovered significant patterns and trends in India’s historical rainfall and developed insightful visualizations
including statewise rainfall, monthly trends, regional comparisons, and correlation between rainfall and temperature
